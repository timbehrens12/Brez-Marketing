# Using Date Range Filtering in the Marketing Dashboard

This guide explains how to use the date range filtering feature to analyze campaign performance over specific time periods.

## Overview

The date range filtering feature allows you to:

- View campaign metrics for specific time periods
- Compare current performance with previous periods
- Analyze trends over time
- Make data-driven decisions based on accurate, time-specific metrics

## How to Use Date Range Filtering

### Accessing the Date Range Filter

1. Log in to the Marketing Dashboard
2. Navigate to the Meta tab in the dashboard
3. Look for the date range selector in the top-right corner of the page

### Selecting a Date Range

1. Click on the date range selector
2. Choose a start date and end date for your analysis
3. Click "Apply" to filter the data

The dashboard will update to show campaign metrics for the selected date range only.

### Available Metrics with Date Filtering

When you apply a date filter, the following metrics will be updated:

- Ad Spend
- Impressions
- Clicks
- Reach
- Conversions
- Click-Through Rate (CTR)
- Cost Per Click (CPC)
- Cost Per Conversion
- Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

### Comparing with Previous Periods

The dashboard automatically calculates the change from the previous period of equal length. For example:

- If you select April 1-15, the previous period is March 17-31
- If you select the last 7 days, the previous period is the 7 days before that

The percentage change is displayed next to each metric, showing whether performance has improved or declined.

### Understanding Trend Calculations

Trends are calculated as follows:

1. Current value: Sum of metrics over the selected date range
2. Previous value: Sum of metrics over the previous period of equal length
3. Percentage change: ((Current - Previous) / Previous) * 100

If the previous value is zero, the trend will show as "N/A" to avoid division by zero.

## Best Practices

### Analyzing Campaign Performance

- **Short-term analysis**: Use 7-day or 14-day ranges to identify recent trends
- **Month-to-month comparison**: Compare the same date range across different months
- **Campaign lifecycle**: Select the entire campaign duration to assess overall performance

### Data Interpretation

- **Context matters**: Consider external factors that might affect performance during specific date ranges
- **Consistent comparisons**: Use the same date ranges when comparing different campaigns
- **Statistical significance**: Longer date ranges generally provide more reliable data

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Available

If you see "No data available" after selecting a date range:

1. Check if the campaign was active during the selected period
2. Ensure that the last sync was successful
3. Try a different date range to see if data appears

### Incorrect Metrics

If metrics seem incorrect for a selected date range:

1. Click the "Sync Now" button to refresh the data
2. Check if the campaign was modified during the selected period
3. Contact support if the issue persists
