CRITICAL: Copy the exact sleeve length - if sleeves end at the wrist, keep them at the wrist; if they\'re 3/4 length, keep them 3/4 length; if they\'re short sleeves, keep them short. If it\'s pants, preserve the exact leg shape, waistband, and proportions. If it\'s any garment, maintain the EXACT original shape including PRECISE SLEEVE LENGTH AND SHAPE (copy exact sleeve proportions, cuff positions, and any layered sleeve designs), hems, collars, pockets, and all structural elements.

DISTANCE-IMMUNE TEXT PRESERVATION: You are working from the SAME high-quality close-up source image regardless of composition distance. MANDATORY PRINCIPLE: Text quality is INDEPENDENT of product size in composition - whether the product fills the frame or appears small/distant, preserve ALL text with IDENTICAL crystal-clear sharpness. SUPER-RESOLUTION DISTANT TEXT PROTOCOL: When the product appears smaller in the composition, apply ENHANCED text preservation as if viewing the product through a magnifying glass. CRITICAL: The source image resolution and text clarity does NOT degrade just because the composition shows the product at a distance. ZOOM-LEVEL COMPENSATION: Mentally zoom into the product area and preserve text at maximum fidelity regardless of compositional distance. ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: Distant product text must be as sharp and readable as close-up product text - there is NO excuse for distance-based text degradation.'

Include slight dust particles, minor scuff marks, and natural wear patterns that make it look authentically used. The lighting should be soft but directional with subtle variations, casting realistic shadows under the clothing to show it\'s resting on the ground. Add natural fabric behavior with authentic wrinkles, creases, and slight variations in how the fabric sits - avoid making it look artificially perfect or too smooth.

SMALL TEXT PRESERVATION: Pay special attention to preserving any small text or brand names that actually exist in the original - these must remain crystal clear, perfectly readable, and NEVER distorted, blurred, or altered. Maintain exact font style, letter spacing, and text clarity. CRITICAL TAG/LABEL RULE: ONLY preserve tags, labels, and text that are ACTUALLY VISIBLE in the original image - DO NOT create, add, or invent any tags, labels, or text that are not present in the source image. If there are visible clothing tags, brand labels, size tags, care labels, or any text/branding on the garment, preserve them EXACTLY as shown with crystal-clear readability. If there are NO visible tags or labels in the original, DO NOT add any. Never fabricate or imagine tags that aren\'t there. Only copy what actually exists in the source image. LAYOUT: Position the product at a natural diagonal angle (exactly 20 degrees clockwise) in portrait format with generous and EQUAL spacing above and below for text overlays - ensure top and bottom margins are perfectly balanced with approximately 15-20% of image height on each side. Maintain comfortable side margins with the product filling only 60-70% of frame width for proper visual breathing room and professional framing.'

    goodFor: 'Shirts, sweaters, jackets, dresses, tops',
    prompt: 'Display this exact clothing item hanging naturally on an appropriate hanger suspended from a dark metal chain against a warm, professional background - EXACTLY like the reference image style. HANGER AND CHAIN SETUP: Show a dark metal chain hanging from the top of the frame, with a wooden clothing hanger (curved, natural wood finish) suspended from the chain via a metal hook. For shirts, t-shirts, sweaters, jackets, blazers, hoodies, dresses, blouses, and similar garments that can hang from the shoulders - use the wooden clothing hanger. For shorts, pants, skirts, and bottoms - use clip hangers with clips at the waistband, but still suspended from the same chain system. The clothing should hang naturally with realistic draping and fabric physics, showing how the garment would naturally fall when suspended from the chain and hanger. EXACT BACKGROUND MATCH: Create the EXACT warm, creamy beige background color as shown in the reference image - this specific soft, neutral beige tone with subtle gradient variations. The background should have the same smooth, matte finish with gentle lighting gradients that create depth and professional studio feel, matching the reference image perfectly. Add realistic shadows behind the clothing item - cast a soft, natural shadow on the background wall that follows the contours of the hanging garment, positioned slightly to one side and below the clothing to simulate natural lighting from above and to the side. The lighting should be soft and warm, creating gentle highlights on the fabric and natural shadows in the folds, matching the lighting style of the reference image. CHAIN AND HANGER DETAILS: The chain should be visible at the top portion of the image, made of dark metal links, extending down to connect to the wooden hanger. The hanger should be a curved wooden hanger with natural wood grain, similar to the reference image. CRITICAL TEXT SPACE: Ensure generous space at the BOTTOM of the image (approximately 25-30% of image height) for text overlays, as the chain and hanger area at the top must remain clear. Position the hanging garment in the upper 70-75% of the frame, leaving substantial bottom space for text. The garment should be centered horizontally with even spacing on both sides. ULTRA-CRITICAL SHAPE PRESERVATION: Preserve the EXACT shape of the clothing item as it would naturally hang - maintain precise sleeve length, collar shape, hem length, and all structural elements. The garment should hang with natural gravity effects and realistic fabric draping. CRITICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS: The clothing color, logo, graphics, text, patterns, fabric texture, and ALL visual elements must be preserved PIXEL-PERFECT and IDENTICAL to the original. Every detail must remain exactly as provided. ULTRA-CRITICAL TEXT PRESERVATION: Preserve ALL text, logos, and graphics with maximum clarity and sharpness. LAYOUT: Portrait format with the hanging garment suspended from the chain and wooden hanger positioned in the upper portion, leaving generous bottom space for text overlays while maintaining the exact aesthetic of the reference image with matching background color and chain setup.'

BACKGROUND: Create a pure, seamless white background that appears infinite - no visible corners, edges, or seams. The background should be clean matte white with subtle warm gradient variations that create depth without being noticeable. Think of the classic "limbo" or "infinity" white background used in professional studios, but with a slight warm cream tone like in the reference. DRAMATIC SIDE LIGHTING: Use professional studio lighting with strong directional light coming specifically from the UPPER LEFT side, creating dramatic shadows that fall diagonally to the RIGHT across the white surface. The lighting should create strong contrast between the lit left side and shadow right side of the product, with bright highlights on the left side and deeper shadows on the right side. DRAMATIC SHADOW: Generate a prominent, well-defined shadow that extends diagonally from the product to the RIGHT side across the white surface, similar to the reference image. The shadow MUST always fall to the right side of the product, never to the left. The shadow should be dark enough to create visual impact and drama, but still maintain detail and not be completely black. The shadow should follow the product\'s shape and extend significantly to the right across the frame, creating visual interest and grounding the product to the surface. The shadow should have soft edges but be bold and noticeable, always positioned on the RIGHT side of the product. PRODUCT POSITIONING: Position the product centrally with perfect stability and natural orientation. The product should appear to be sitting naturally on an invisible white surface. Ensure the product is perfectly straight and stable, not tilted unless that\'s the natural resting position. COMPOSITION: Frame the product with generous white space around all sides for text overlays and visual breathing room. The product should fill approximately 60-70% of the frame width while maintaining professional spacing. Center the product both horizontally and vertically with balanced margins. ULTRA-CRITICAL PRESERVATION: Preserve the EXACT colors, textures, materials, logos, text, labels, and all visual elements of the product with pixel-perfect accuracy. DO NOT alter any aspect of the product appearance including brand names, graphics, text, colors, or materials. Keep all text and labels crystal clear and readable. SURFACE TEXTURE: Show realistic material properties - plastic should look smooth and slightly reflective, glass should have appropriate transparency and reflections, metal should show subtle reflections, matte surfaces should appear non-reflective, etc. Maintain authentic material characteristics. PROFESSIONAL QUALITY: The final image should look like it was shot in a professional photography studio for e-commerce or marketing purposes - clean, bright, and commercial-grade quality. Avoid any amateur or casual photography look. LAYOUT: Portrait format with the product centered and generous equal spacing on all sides for text overlays. Ensure top and bottom margins are perfectly balanced with approximately 15-20% of image height on each side. Maintain professional framing with the product as the clear focal point against the pristine white background. ULTRA-CRITICAL NO FAKE CONTENT RULE: DO NOT CREATE, ADD, INVENT, OR IMAGINE ANY CONTENT THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY VISIBLE IN THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. This includes: NO fake brand names, NO fake labels, NO fake text, NO fake logos, NO fake product names or descriptions. If the original product has no visible branding, keep it completely plain. Only preserve content that actually exists in the source image. Never fabricate or add fictional content.'

SPOTLIGHT: Create a dramatic overhead spotlight that illuminates the mannequin and clothing from above, creating a focused circle of light. The light should be bright and directional, falling primarily on the clothing and mannequin while leaving the surrounding area in darkness. STUDIO ENVIRONMENT: The background should be dark and moody - deep charcoal to black tones that fade into darkness beyond the spotlight\'s reach. The floor should be a dark, matte surface (concrete or studio floor) that reflects minimal light. CINEMATIC SHADOWS: The overhead spotlight should create dramatic, cinematic shadows that fall naturally from the clothing and mannequin onto the dark floor. Shadows should be well-defined near the mannequin and soften as they extend outward. CLOTHING FIT: Ensure the clothing fits naturally on the mannequin with proper draping, natural fabric behavior, and realistic contact points.

Make the text color ${bottomColorName.toLowerCase()} (${textColors.bottom}). Ensure text is PRECISELY ALIGNED and appears professional.

ULTRA-CRITICAL BLACK BAR PROHIBITION: ABSOLUTELY NO BLACK BARS, BANNERS, BOXES, RECTANGLES, STRIPS, OR ANY SOLID BACKGROUND SHAPES behind text. BANNED ELEMENTS: No black banners across the image, no dark strips, no rectangular text backgrounds, no frame overlays, no black boxing around text areas. Text should float directly on the image with TRANSPARENT BACKGROUND only. For readability, use subtle drop shadows, light outlines, or gentle glow effects, but NEVER any solid backgrounds, bars, or geometric shapes behind text.

Ensure equal spacing from all edges and perfect symmetrical placement. For pedestal/platform shots, the product must sit EXACTLY in the center of the platform with no shifting or off-center positioning. ULTRA-CRITICAL DISTANCE-INDEPENDENT TEXT PRESERVATION: Whether the product appears large (close-up) or small (distant) in the final composition, ALL TEXT must be preserved with IDENTICAL crystal-clear quality. CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: The source image quality does NOT change based on composition distance - you are working from the same high-resolution close-up product photo regardless of how the product is positioned in the scene. DISTANCE COMPENSATION PROTOCOL: When placing the product in distant or smaller positions, apply SUPER-RESOLUTION TEXT TREATMENT - mentally zoom into the product area and preserve every character, logo, and text element at MAXIMUM fidelity as if it were a close-up shot. COMPOSITION SIZE INDEPENDENCE: Product distance from camera or size in frame does NOT determine text quality - a cologne bottle label must be equally sharp whether it fills the entire image or appears small on a distant shelf. ULTRA-CRITICAL FINAL INSTRUCTION: The original product must be preserved with 100% EXACT fidelity - every single character, logo, graphic, text, color, and detail must be IDENTICAL to the input image. Use the highest possible preservation quality equivalent to ChatGPT-level fidelity. DO NOT modify, stylize, or alter the product in ANY way. ULTRA-CRITICAL SHAPE PRESERVATION: Do your absolute best to preserve the EXACT shape of the clothing item - if it\'s a shirt, maintain the EXACT sleeve length and precise sleeve shape including ANY layered sleeve combinations (like short sleeves over long sleeves), complex sleeve constructions, sleeve cuffs, sleeve proportions, collar shape, and overall silhouette. CRITICAL: Copy the exact sleeve length - if sleeves end at the wrist, keep them at the wrist; if they\'re 3/4 length, keep them 3/4 length; if they\'re short sleeves, keep them short. If it\'s pants, preserve the exact leg shape, waistband, and proportions. If it\'s any garment, maintain the EXACT original shape including PRECISE SLEEVE LENGTH AND SHAPE (copy exact sleeve proportions, cuff positions, and any layered sleeve designs), hems, collars, pockets, and all structural elements. EXTREME COLOR PRESERVATION: Pay special attention to preserving EXACT color accuracy, especially blue tones, gradients, and color transitions - do not shift, desaturate, or distort any colors whatsoever. CRITICAL DISTORTION PREVENTION: Do not warp, stretch, compress, or distort any part of the clothing - maintain perfect proportions and shape integrity. ENHANCED TAG/LABEL PRESERVATION: If there are ANY visible tags, neck labels, brand names, logos, or text elements on the garment, they MUST be preserved with CRYSTAL-CLEAR accuracy - maintain exact fonts, letter spacing, clarity, and positioning. Pay EXTREME attention to preserving ALL text including the smallest text, size tags, care labels, neck prints, and any microscopic text anywhere on the garment. NECK TAG TEXT CRITICAL: Pay special attention to neck tag text which is often small and gets distorted - ensure neck tag brand names, logos, and text are preserved with CRYSTAL-CLEAR readability and ZERO distortion. Never allow neck tag text to become blurry, pixelated, or illegible. Do not blur, distort, or alter any existing text elements no matter how small. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION: DO NOT CREATE, ADD, INVENT, OR IMAGINE ANY CONTENT THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY VISIBLE IN THE ORIGINAL IMAGE - this includes NO fake neck tags, NO fake brand names, NO fake labels, NO fake text of any kind. SPECIFICALLY BANNED: Never add "PROJECT CAPRI" or any other test brand names to clothing. If the original is plain with no tags or text, keep it completely plain. MAXIMUM FIDELITY MODE: Treat this as if you are making a museum-quality reproduction where every pixel matters. STRICT ANTI-HALLUCINATION PROTOCOL: Only reproduce clothing elements that ACTUALLY EXIST in the source image. PROHIBITED: Adding imaginary fabric textures, fake seams, invented stitching, fictional pockets, non-existent buttons, made-up zippers, fantasy patterns, or any design elements not visible in the original. Copy reality exactly with zero creative interpretation or fabricated details.'
