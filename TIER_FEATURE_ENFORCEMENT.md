## Features That Need Enforcement

### 1. **White Label / Custom Branding** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Who has it:** Beginner, Growing, Scaling, Agency  
**Who doesn't:** DTC Owner

**What needs to happen:**
- DTC Owner tier should be **FORCED** to use platform branding (Brez logo/name)
- DTC Owner should **NOT** be able to customize agency settings (logo, name, colors)
- Higher tiers can fully customize branding

**Where to enforce:**
- `/settings` page - Agency Settings section
- Brand Report generation - Use platform branding for DTC Owner
- Email templates - Use platform branding for DTC Owner
- Outreach emails - Use platform branding for DTC Owner

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// In agency settings page
const { data: tierLimits } = await getUserTierLimits(userId)
if (!tierLimits?.white_label) {
  // Lock agency logo/name fields
  // Show upgrade prompt
  // Force use of platform defaults
}
```

---

### 2. **Lead Generation Access** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Who has it:** Beginner (100), Growing (300), Scaling (1000), Agency (5000)  
**Who doesn't:** DTC Owner (0)

**What needs to happen:**
- DTC Owner should be **BLOCKED** from accessing `/lead-generator` page entirely
- Show upgrade prompt instead

**Where to enforce:**
- `/lead-generator` page - Block access at page level
- Sidebar navigation - Hide/lock Lead Generator link for DTC Owner
- API route `/api/leads/generate-real` - Block requests

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// In lead-generator page
const { data: tierLimits } = await getUserTierLimits(userId)
if (tierLimits?.lead_gen_monthly === 0) {
  return <UpgradePrompt feature="Lead Generation" currentTier="DTC Owner" recommendedTier="Beginner" />
}
```

---

### 3. **Outreach CRM Access** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Who has it:** Beginner (250), Growing (750), Scaling (2500), Agency (10000)  
**Who doesn't:** DTC Owner (0)

**What needs to happen:**
- DTC Owner should be **BLOCKED** from accessing `/outreach-tool` page entirely
- Show upgrade prompt instead

**Where to enforce:**
- `/outreach-tool` page - Block access at page level
- Sidebar navigation - Hide/lock Outreach Tool link for DTC Owner
- API route `/api/outreach/generate-message` - Block requests

---

### 4. **Team Members / Seats** üü° IMPORTANT
**Limits:**
- DTC Owner: 0 (solo only)
- Beginner: 0 (solo only)
- Growing: 1 additional seat
- Scaling: 3 additional seats
- Agency: 10 additional seats

**What needs to happen:**
- Block team member invitations if limit reached
- Show current usage vs limit
- Show upgrade prompt when trying to exceed

**Where to enforce:**
- `/settings` page - Team Management section
- API route `/api/agency-team` - Block invitations over limit
- Already has `canAddTeamMember()` function - just need to use it

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Already exists in tier-access.ts
const { allowed, limit, current } = await canAddTeamMember(userId)
if (!allowed) {
  return <UpgradePrompt feature="Team Members" currentUsage={current} limit={limit} />
}
```

---

### 5. **Brand Connections** üü° IMPORTANT
**Limits:**
- DTC Owner: 1
- Beginner: 1
- Growing: 5
- Scaling: 15
- Agency: Unlimited (9999)

**What needs to happen:**
- Block brand creation if limit reached
- Show current usage vs limit
- Show upgrade prompt when trying to exceed

**Where to enforce:**
- Brand creation flow - Block if limit reached
- Already has `canAddBrand()` function - just need to use it

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Already exists in tier-access.ts
const { allowed, limit, current } = await canAddBrand(userId)
if (!allowed) {
  return <UpgradePrompt feature="Brand Connections" currentUsage={current} limit={limit} />
}
```

---

### 6. **Priority Support Badge** üü¢ NICE TO HAVE
**Who has it:** Growing, Scaling, Agency  
**Who doesn't:** DTC Owner, Beginner

**What needs to happen:**
- Show "Priority Support" badge in settings for eligible tiers
- Prioritize support tickets from these tiers (backend)

---

### 7. **Dedicated Account Manager** üü¢ NICE TO HAVE
**Who has it:** Scaling, Agency  
**Who doesn't:** DTC Owner, Beginner, Growing

**What needs to happen:**
- Show account manager contact info for eligible tiers
- Display in settings or dashboard

---

## Files That Need Updates

### 1. Create Tier Enforcement Service
**File:** `lib/services/tier-enforcement-service.ts`
```typescript
export class TierEnforcementService {
  async canAccessFeature(userId: string, feature: string): Promise<boolean>
  async getUpgradePrompt(userId: string, feature: string): Promise<UpgradePromptData>
  async enforceWhiteLabel(userId: string): Promise<{ allowed: boolean; settings: any }>
}
```

### 2. Update Pages with Enforcement
- `app/lead-generator/page.tsx` - Add tier check
- `app/outreach-tool/page.tsx` - Add tier check
- `app/settings/page.tsx` - Lock white label for DTC Owner
- `app/brand-report/page.tsx` - Force platform branding for DTC Owner

### 3. Update Sidebar Navigation
- `components/Sidebar.tsx` - Show locks/badges on restricted features

### 4. Create Upgrade Prompt Component
**File:** `components/tier/UpgradePrompt.tsx`
```typescript
<UpgradePrompt
  feature="Lead Generation"
  currentTier="DTC Owner"
  recommendedTier="Beginner"
  reason="Lead Generation is not available on the DTC Owner plan"
/>
```

### 5. Update API Routes
- `app/api/leads/generate-real/route.ts` - Check tier before generating
- `app/api/outreach/generate-message/route.ts` - Check tier before sending
- `app/api/agency-settings/route.ts` - Enforce white label restrictions
- `app/api/agency-team/route.ts` - Enforce team member limits
