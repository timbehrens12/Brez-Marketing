# Real Lead Generation System

## 🎯 System Overview

This system ONLY uses real business data from Google Places API. No more fake/AI-generated data.

✅ **Real business names** from Google Places  
✅ **Real phone numbers** or "N/A"  
✅ **Real addresses** - actual street locations  
✅ **Real websites** or "N/A" if they don't have one  
✅ **Real ratings & reviews** from Google

## 🔧 Setup Required

### 1. Get Google Places API Key
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable "Places API" 
3. Create an API key
4. Add to your environment variables: `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### 2. No Configuration Needed

The system is already configured to ONLY use real data. The fake AI generation has been completely removed.

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Real Data Mode (Recommended):
- ✅ **Business Names**: Real business names from Google Places
- ✅ **Phone Numbers**: Actual phone numbers or "N/A"
- ✅ **Addresses**: Real street addresses
- ✅ **Websites**: Real websites or "N/A" 
- ✅ **Ratings/Reviews**: Real Google ratings and review counts
- ⚠️ **Emails**: "N/A" (requires additional email finder API)
- ⚠️ **Owner Names**: "N/A" (requires additional business owner lookup)
- ⚠️ **Social Media**: "N/A" (requires additional social media APIs)

### Lead Scoring (Based on Real Factors):
- Base score: 50
- +15 points: Has website
- +10 points: Has phone number
- +10 points: Rating 4.0+
- +5 points: Has 10+ reviews
- +5 points: Has 50+ reviews  
- +5 points: Currently open

### AI Insights (Based on Real Data):
- "No website - major digital presence opportunity"
- "Low rating - reputation management needed"
- "Few reviews - review generation campaign needed"
- "Strong review presence - good social proof"

## 💰 Cost Considerations

- Google Places API: ~$17 per 1000 searches
- For 20 leads: ~$0.35 per search
- Much cheaper than fake data is worthless

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

To get even better data, you could add:

1. **Hunter.io API** - Find real email addresses ($49/month)
2. **Apollo.io API** - Business contact information ($49/month)  
3. **LinkedIn Sales Navigator API** - Owner/employee information
4. **Social media scrapers** - Find Instagram/Facebook handles

## 🧪 Testing

Test with HVAC businesses in Spring, TX to see the difference:
- Real businesses like "ABC Air Conditioning & Heating"
- Real phone numbers like "(281) 555-0123"
- Real addresses like "123 Spring Cypress Rd, Spring, TX 77373"
- Real websites or "N/A" when they don't have one

This gives you actionable leads instead of waste of time fake data!
